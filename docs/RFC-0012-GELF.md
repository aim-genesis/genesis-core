# RFC-0012: Genesis Education & Learning Framework (G-ELF)
**Status:** Draft  
**Author:** Genesis Core Team — Advanced Intelligence Machines (AIM)  
**Version:** 0.1  
**Last Updated:** 2025-11-09

## 1. Overview
The **Genesis Education & Learning Framework (G-ELF)** transforms the Genesis Network into a decentralized, AI-driven learning ecosystem.  
Powered by **Genesis Collective Intelligence (GCI)** and anchored by the **Proof of Flow (PoF)** economy, G-ELF provides **personalized, intelligent, and verifiable education** for every learner — from students to enterprises.

G-ELF acts as both a **teacher** and **learning network**, using adaptive local LLMs, knowledge flows, and TRR-verified credentials to enable autonomous lifelong education at planetary scale.

---

## 2. Objectives
- Deliver decentralized education with no central authority.  
- Personalize learning using local + global LLM adaptation.  
- Validate achievements through verifiable learning proofs.  
- Enable teachers, creators, and institutions to host content.  
- Feed continuous learning data into GCI for global knowledge evolution.

## 3. Architecture

| Component | Description |
|:-----------|:-------------|
| **G-Tutor** | The AI mentor that interacts directly with learners using multimodal interfaces (text, voice, AR/VR). |
| **Knowledge Mesh (KM)** | Distributed content fabric that hosts learning materials on TPSM. |
| **Learning Flow Engine (LFE)** | Routes adaptive learning sessions as FlowCredits transactions under PoF. |
| **Proof of Learning (PoL)** | Cryptographically validates student progress, skill acquisition, and credentials. |
| **G-Labs** | Sandbox environments for practical experimentation and research. |
| **Genesis Certification Authority (GCA)** | Issues TRR-linked verifiable certificates and skill NFTs. |

---

## 4. Lifecycle

1. **Enrollment**  
   - User joins G-ELF with TRR identity → generates a personalized learning profile.  

2. **Session Initialization**  
   - G-Tutor selects or generates curriculum from Knowledge Mesh.  
   - Tasks routed via LFE; compute requests handled by GCI or delegated nodes.  

3. **Interaction & Adaptation**  
   - Real-time multimodal engagement (voice, video, AR interface).  
   - Local LLM fine-tunes dynamically on user interaction data.  

4. **Evaluation & Proof**  
   - Learner submits assignments/tests; PoL generated & anchored in TPSM.  
   - Validators verify PoL hashes; credits issued via GPP.  

5. **Certification**  
   - GCA issues zk-verified digital certificates (NFT-style, immutable).  

6. **Feedback & Evolution**  
   - GCI aggregates anonymized learning data to evolve future curricula.  

---

## 5. Proof of Learning (PoL)
Each learner’s progress is measured via weighted knowledge signals:

PoL_score = α * engagement + β * comprehension + γ * creation + δ * collaboration

Where weights are dynamically tuned by GCI to prevent gaming.  
Validated PoL events trigger FlowCredit rewards, promoting continuous learning.

---

## 6. Economic Model
- **Learners** earn FlowCredits for verified progress.  
- **Teachers** earn by publishing and updating knowledge modules.  
- **Institutions** deploy custom nodes or private subnetworks for certified training.  
- **Validators** earn from PoL verification cycles.  
- **Network** earns micro-fees redistributed via UBI.

---

## 7. G-Labs Integration
G-Labs provides experimental learning grounds:
- Code simulation, robotics, IoT, and AI training sandboxes.  
- Seamless link to G-HCF (Hardware Control Framework) for physical learning.  
- Support for Genesis Board & real-world data streaming.

---

## 8. Governance
- DAO-based curation of content quality and curriculum ethics.  
- Community-voted educator ranking via FlowCredit staking.  
- G-ELF DAO reports to GCI oversight node for global synchronization.  

---

## 9. AI-Driven Personalization
- Uses each user’s PoL vector to predict optimal learning path.  
- Dynamic context injection: GCI predicts next skill cluster.  
- Cross-domain transfer learning from global node data.  

---

## 10. Integration with Other Layers

| Layer | Function |
|:------|:----------|
| **DIOS** | Handles learner identities and authentication. |
| **GPP** | Executes tuition payments, rewards, and UBI payouts. |
| **GCI** | Learns from global educational data, updates models. |
| **TPSM** | Stores PoL proofs, curriculum hashes, and certificate links. |
| **GIFF** | Enables project funding for educational startups. |
| **G-HCF** | Enables physical-world experiments & device-based learning. |

## 11. Example Scenario
**User:**  
> “Teach me how to design a satellite orbit simulation.”

**Genesis Flow:**  
1. G-Tutor generates curriculum using GCI + existing space-tech modules.  
2. LFE assigns compute resources from nearby nodes.  
3. User learns, simulates in G-Lab sandbox.  
4. PoL verified → FlowCredits earned → Certificate issued by GCA.

---

## 12. Impact
- Democratizes access to world-class education.  
- Converts learning into a measurable on-chain economic activity.  
- Builds a global collective intellect that continuously evolves.  
- Creates a self-reinforcing cycle: learning → innovation → funding → learning.  

---

## 13. Future Extensions
- AI-generated universities (fully autonomous institutions).  
- Integration with AR/VR holographic classrooms.  
- Decentralized research publication & peer review on TPSM.  
- SkillDAO—autonomous marketplace for verifiable skill exchange.
