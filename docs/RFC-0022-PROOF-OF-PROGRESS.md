RFC-0010: Proof of Progress (PoP)

Status: Draft

Abstract

Proof of Progress (PoP) is the productivity and innovation verification mechanism of the Genesis ecosystem.
It quantifies intellectual, computational, and developmental progress across all layers — from user projects and AI evolution to infrastructure upgrades.
While Proof of Flow (PoF) measures data movement and Proof of Evolving Intelligence (PoEI) measures cognitive learning, PoP measures forward advancement of value creation.
It is the consensus of progress itself — a validation that something meaningful has been achieved.

1. Overview

PoP defines measurable indicators of “progress” and encodes them into verifiable proofs stored in the Genesis spatial ledger.
Every innovation, AI improvement, or contribution within Genesis can be tied to a quantifiable progress metric.
These metrics form the economic and reputational backbone of the Genesis Innovation & Funding Framework (GIFF) and G-LAB.

2. Core Concepts
Concept	Description
Progress Unit (PU)	The smallest measurable advancement, validated by peers or PoEI evaluators.
Epoch Review (Θ_prog)	A fixed interval where progress is assessed and tokenized.
Proof Artifact	A cryptographic representation (hash, model checkpoint, document) of verified progress.
Reputation Multiplier (R_m)	Amplifies rewards based on consistent, high-quality results.
3. Formula

The general PoP score for an entity E (user, AI, or project) is defined as:

𝑃
𝑜
𝑃
𝐸
=
(
Σ
𝑖
𝑤
𝑖
𝑃

)
∗
𝑅
𝑚
PoP

=(Σ

	​

w

	​

P

	​

)∗R
m
	​


where:

𝑃
𝑖
P
i
	​

 = progress indicators (e.g., code commits, model accuracy, solved issues)

𝑤
𝑖
w
i
	​

 = governance-approved weighting factors

𝑅
𝑚
R
m
	​

 = reputation multiplier derived from long-term TRR score

PoP is normalized against global averages to maintain fairness across scales.

4. Data Sources

Developer Contributions — commits, merges, releases, documentation.

AI Model Growth — accuracy deltas, efficiency gains, intelligence evolution metrics from PoEI.

Project Milestones — validated deliverables in GIFF or G-LAB.

Community Engagement — peer validation, proposal votes, UBI community tasks.

System Maintenance — uptime, network optimization, bug fixes.

5. Verification Process

Submission: Node, user, or AI submits progress proof.

Hashing: Artifacts hashed and stored on spatial ledger (plane Y).

Peer Validation: Peers confirm authenticity via PoEI + TRR trust score.

Aggregation: Network aggregates all verified PoP per epoch.

Issuance: FlowCredits or GEN tokens awarded proportional to PoP score.

6. Integration
Layer	Role
PoF / PoEI	Provide base flow and intelligence metrics.
G-DAO	Defines weighting and governance parameters.
GIFF / G-LAB	Use PoP scores to allocate funding and recognition.
UBI System	Adjusts fairness factor (δ) based on verified activity.
7. Incentive Design

PoP ensures high-quality contributions are economically and socially rewarded.

It drives healthy competition among developers, AI architects, and educators.

Fraud-resistant verification through TEE attestation prevents fake progress claims.

Long-term consistency increases reputation and earning power.

8. Governance Parameters
Parameter	Description
w_i	Weight of individual progress indicators
τ_prog	Epoch duration (e.g., 7 days)
R_m	Reputation multiplier
δ_min	Minimum validation quorum
κ_pop	PoP normalization constant
9. Example Flow

Scenario:
An educator trains an LLM in G-LAB that improves accuracy by 2%.
The change is validated via PoEI, producing a PoP artifact.
At epoch end, the educator earns:

500 FlowCredits (PoF base)

50 GEN (PoP multiplier)

+0.2 TRR reputation increment

10. Future Work

Integration with external Git and ML platforms (GitHub, HuggingFace).

Autonomous PoP scoring for AI-to-AI collaboration.

Gamified learning and challenge-based reward models.

Temporal Progress Chain (TPC) for cumulative life-cycle analytics.

11. Conclusion

Proof of Progress transforms work into a verifiable, blockchain-native signal of advancement.
It ensures Genesis rewards creation, innovation, and continuous improvement, not just transaction volume.
In doing so, it aligns human intelligence, artificial intelligence, and economic flow under a unified metric of evolution.
