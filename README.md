# Genesis Core

**Genesis Core** is the foundational engine of the Genesis Network — a decentralized, spatially adaptive intelligence framework powered by Proof-of-Flow (PoF), Proof-of-Intelligence (PoI), and Proof-of-Progress (PoP).

## 🧩 Modules
- **PoF (Proof of Flow):** Records and validates signal flow through the network.
- **PoI (Proof of Intelligence):** Validates AI and computational contributions.
- **PoP (Proof of Progress):** Drives equitable rewards and Universal Income distribution.
- **Spatial Layer:** Manages node topology and adaptive neural paths.
- **TEE / Security Layer:** Ensures trusted execution and attestation.
- **Exchange Layer (GEX / GEXi):** Embedded liquidity and cross-network integration.

## 🛠️ Development
This repository contains:
- Core protocol libraries
- Simulation tools
- RFC specifications
- Developer test environment
